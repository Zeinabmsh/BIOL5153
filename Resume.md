**Title**: Scaled-up method for Rapid Simultaneous Drying and Microbial Decontamination of Corn using Infrared Heat  
**Abstract**: Using infrared heating (IR) for corn drying has a competitive edge over the classical heated air drying methods due to the associated higher and faster rate of heat delivery to the dried product surface, more efficient and environment friendlier drying process, and most importantly the potential of the IR heating process to decontaminate harmful mold spores that would survive heated air drying of the corn. This study investigated the duration required to dry freshly-harvested corn samples from initial moisture content (MC) of 21 percent wet basis (w.b) to the safe storage MC of 13.5 percent w.b; the study also investigated the resulting microbial decontamination. Treatments were performed with corn samples at bed thicknesses of 1.5, 2.7 and 4.5 cm. A pilot-scale, continuous-flow, radiant heating system equipped with catalytic IR emitters was used to conduct the corn drying. The conditions of the experiments were at 5.55 kW/m2 for IR heating intensity, fixed product-to-emitter-gap size of 450 mm, belt drive speed of 0.11 m/s and intermittent heating duration of 30 s. Corn was successfully dried to the safe storage MC using the IR drier. Duration required to reduce the corn MC from 21 to 13.5 percent depended on the corn bed thickness. Results indicated that when corn bed thickness increased from 1.5 to 4.5 cm, the total drying duration significantly increased. This research also revealed that the drying was feasible with simultaneous decontamination of microbes on the corn.

**Master’s Research**  
Faculty of Food Sciences and Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran  
**Thesis**: Aflatoxin B1 in animal feed and aflatoxin M1 in raw milk : occurrence and safety evaluation (This research has been done in Nestlé Chemistry Lab, Ghazvin, Iran)
Advisors: Dr. Mehrdad Ghavami and Dr. Hamid Ezzatpanah  
**Abstract**: My Master’s study aims to investigate contamination of aflatoxin B1 in individual feed and feed mixture for high yielding and low yielding dairy cows and to investigate aflatoxin M1 contamination in the milk samples from high and low yielding dairy cows that were fed by aforementioned feedstuff. Experiments were carried out in two different industrial farms in Ghazvin, Iran. Milk sampling was done 24 hours after feeding the dairy cows with feed samples. The ELISA method is utilized to analyze aflatoxin B1 in feed and aflatoxin M1 in milk. To investigate the effect of climate change, the samples were taken in two different seasons (raining and dry).
